* graphical distortion really works. especially as part of the drinking / pills / hangover
* glorifies shooting, but not so much violence or killing, in a weird way. style is rewarded visually with slo mo.
* the noir setting and casting and voice acting is amazing
* when your gimmick is quite simple, it can drag after a while, even when it's really fun
* starting with a flashback can be powerful, but must be fairly quick to get back to it.
* shorter term flashback work very well. playing in present tense, flashing back.
