* Really great music, sound effects, and pixel art. Lots of attention to detail, especially wrt animation: the interface and the world feels alive; characters bounce and stretch and squeeze.
* Unashamedly about the *fun* of gaming. Run, jump, shoot!
* Really shines in multiplayer mode, but singleplayer is a bit weak.
