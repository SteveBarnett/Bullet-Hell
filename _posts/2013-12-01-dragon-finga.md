* Beautiful graphics. Character animation is silky smooth, and design is lovely.
* Classic "Tutorial All The Things!" up front. Better to space it out a bit? Also felt a bit hand-holdy: a few too many "tap on this, tap on that" prompts where they weren't really needed.
* Control system (flick character to move, tap enemies to attack) is interesting, but not very intuitive or precise. Easy to devolve into button-mashing: just tap tap tap every enemy.
* Large jumps break the flow: the screen is too zoomed in on the action to figure out where you're going.
* Leveling up is well spaced and paced. Just a handful of options, well chosen.
