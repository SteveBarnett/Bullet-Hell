* Tutorial levels with show don't tell are good
  * But twelve of them in a row are dull. Especially when they are super short, and you get the same jingle after every level.
* Teleporting mechanic is cute, especially the swapping.
  * But not entirely intuitive. Indirect control often has that problem.
* Having extra bonus points for levels is great (number if orbs collected, number if teleports)
  * But showed your fail of them in red doesn't make sense. Was supposed to be optional Should be presented as blank instead: you didn't win that extra prize rather than you lost.
