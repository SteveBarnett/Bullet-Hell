- The possess-things-and-people-using-your-magic-hat mechanic is interesting and clever (but a bit inconsistent), but becomes a little creepy. Or disturbing. Or something like that. You might become a sheep or a giant zipper (yes, really).
- Incredible, ongoing, innovation in puzzles and places. New stuff around every corner.
- Maps! The map for each level is presented like a tourist guide to a town, with little tidbits of cute extra info. This might be what they mean when they talk about "delight" in UX, not an extra animation when you click a button.
- Still not sure if it was really bad trip or a really good one (for me and for the game designers).
