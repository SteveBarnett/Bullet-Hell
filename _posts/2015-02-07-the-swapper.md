* Beautiful, atmosppheric, graphics and sound design. Deserted / haunted space station vibes that work very well.
* The red light / blue light constraints feel very artifical. Would've preferred something that felt like it was part of world.
* Nice use of short, poignant, cutscenes.
* Cunning and tricksy puzzles.
