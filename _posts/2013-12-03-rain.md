* After the beatiful, colourful, watercolor splattered intro, the dull greyness of the game world is a bit of a let down at first. It's rich and detailed, though, and the tall buildings combined with the alternating high and low camera angles give the setting a lot of drama. The sections by the river are especially beautiful.
* The style of narration is overly flowery; all the adverbs! Overlaying that text on tilted 3D planes over the world works great, though.
* Beasts really hate scaffolding. More than they hate you.
* The helping each other out mechanic is a good idea, but not well realised. Not explored in enough variations, or with enough originality to be amazing. Feels too much like a bad copy of Ico.
