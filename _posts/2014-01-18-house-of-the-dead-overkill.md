* Classic grindhouse tropes: scratched film; dirty guitar riffs; Wild West vibes.
* Interesting controls for a shooter. Doesn't use the usual tap-the-screen: small trackpad on the left, shoot (and reload, and change weapon, and smart bomb) on the right. Actually kinda works, since it's not the usual virtual joysticks.
* Fun. Bit sillier than previous HotD games, and better for it.
