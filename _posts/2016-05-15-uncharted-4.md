* Terrible first impression. A boot / loading screen that doesn't show progress or any signs of activity. Having to wade through screens of configuration before actually playing the game. I just wanna run and jump and stuff!
* Great secondary impression. Once you start the game, you dive straight into the action and that's swiftly followed by some scene setting and control familiarisation.
* Ridiculously high production values. The environments are so, so, pretty and detailed and believable. Great script, fantastic voice acting, really great mocap.
* The climbing around is fun but can feel a little hackneyed and forced. It's a weird mix of "that sort of looks like a handhold I guess" and "oh, I can see the three ledges that are magically on this big rock in exactly the right place."
* Kinda samey. The story doesn't get as weird as previous outings, the gameplay mechanics aren't stretched as wide, the set pieces aren't quite as epic.
* A fitting, if slightly trite, ending.
