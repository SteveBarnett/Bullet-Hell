* Incredible production values. Great cinematography, stunning visual design on the environments, technology, and the game UI. Augmented reality. New aesthetic.
* Useful loading screens: shows tips, as many do, but let's you click to go to the next.
* Memory tinkering is very interesting. The idea is great. The mechanic of it in-game is a little clunky, but okay. The ideological / philosophical way they play with it is ace.
* Great to have a female lead who doesn't wear ridiculous skimpy clothes. Still about too much butt-cam, though.
