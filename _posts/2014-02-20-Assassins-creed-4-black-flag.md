* incredible graphics. Amazingly detailed landscapes and people.
* Controls are a bit wonky. Buttons are occasionally for a single task, breaking the flow. Parkouring is generally great fun, but sometimes you're a bit too sticky: grabbing or climbing things you wanted to run past. Ship sailing is great, though: appropriately weighty.
* Little bit too much Far Cry: Pirate. Borrows some ideas from FC3, but doesn't implement them quite as well.
* Gets a bit dull quite quickly. Missions (especially side ones) are repetitive.
