* Great, slightly comic book style, art. Lots of great detail and Sci-fi ideas in building design, in-game interfaces, etc.
* Solid script and voice acting. Great character work. Crimson 09 gets *the best* lines. Without wanting to give away plot details: shades of Dollhouse in the later storyline, which is a very good thing.
* Interesting slight tweak on QTEs: more than just button mashing and directions on a controller.
* Patchy animation. Faces are good, but movement isn't that smooth or convincing for people.
