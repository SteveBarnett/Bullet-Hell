* Original combination of classic bits and pieces: an on-rails spot-the-difference shooter, with trains.
* Beautiful, varied, hand-drawn art. Makes you smile when you're playing. Like this: :).
* Lovely guitar soundtrack. Well-matched to the game and the levels, and a good loop length.
* Simple mechanic. Would be nice to have an in-game tutorial on your first play, rather than just the info screen that sit on the menu (and explains the controls).
* Does one thing, and does it very well. Too many games try to do lots of things, and end up being mediocre at them.
* Brilliant Game Over mechanic. End of the line, literally.
