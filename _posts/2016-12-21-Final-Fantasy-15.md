- A fun, if sausage-fest-and-generally-slightly-dodgy-gender-thingys, road trip game. Still felt like a Final Fantasy game despite the many formula changes, but it didn't feel like a great FF game. 7 and 10 still rank highest for me. Probably.
- Despite the fact that there are quite a few things that attract XP of some sort, it doesn't feel too confusing. They're all for quite different things, and the what and why of leveling up is quite different. It makes for fun tweaking of lots of different stats.
- The day / night cycle has a very calming effect. It gives you enough time to do one or two big things before settling down at a camp. Because camping Does Stuff (lets you spend the XP you gained during the day, make food for status buffs the next day, look at the cute photos) if feels like a good, useful, thing to rather than just passing time until the next morning. A very canny design decision. (Ths disappers in the second half of the game, alas)
- The half and half nature of the game makes weird things happen. I found I did very little spending of XP or upgrading of gear in the second half. The railroading of second half is a real shock to the system. It's very constricted. And you are on a (train on a) literal rail road.
- Unsurprisingly visually stunning.
- The combat camera is a more like a wombat camera. It's all over the place and not very good.
- The plot is a bit odd. In places is epic and world-shattering, in other places the world-shattering happens off-camera and is barely mentioned in passing by the group. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
