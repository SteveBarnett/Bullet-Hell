* Beautiful, whimsical, fun and funny world full of weird and wonderful things.
* Awful opening level. Too abstract and undirected, a bit of a dull slog. World opens up beautifully after that, though: colours and characters and pings and pongs and wonder.
* Confusing. Is it a game or not? There are collectables and unlockables (mostly portals), so there's a strong implication of a game mechanic. It's not clear at all what it is, though, or why or how.
