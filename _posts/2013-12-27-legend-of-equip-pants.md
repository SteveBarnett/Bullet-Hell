* Retrol-cool pixel art graphics, spooky soundtrack.
* Full of tropes from classic RPGs, from horror movies.
* Interesting (but sparse) use of In-App Purchases: used for choice trees / morality.
* Full of pants-based puns. (For me, that's a big plus :] )
* Nicely short episodes: little bursts of fun.
