* Striking art style that's quite unique. Very colourful, but always very warm. Very busy, but never messy.
* Lightly touches on lofty (and / or odd, interesting) themes and philosophical ideas. I would have enjoyed a bit more depth and exploration, but it works really great as it is.
* Just the right amount of challenge (a little bit) for such a story-driven game.
* Really enjoyed the lack of HUD, inventory, and so on.
