* Great character design, perfect animation (as you'd expect from a Disney game)
* Physics of the water feel good. Slightly faster / floppies than real life, but works for the game.
* Nice mixing up of types of level: keeps the progression interesting.
* Simple, easy to pick up, and satisfying interface: carving through dirt with a fingertip.
