* Excellent environmental effects, especially as the game goes on. Sun and smoke and trees and **wow**. Such a pleasure to be in the world.
* Great story, great voice acting. Believable, interesting, characters.
* Incredible, really well designed, UI. Attention to detail and smoothness of experience that makes every interaction pleasing.
* Short, but exquisite. Exactly as long as it had to be and no longer. More games like this please!
