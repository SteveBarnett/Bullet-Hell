* Great tutorial. Instructions are explicit: pictures of hands, arrows, showing you what to do.
* Graphics are great. Vector line art style, with spot on touches of animation. Subtle movements on items give them
character / make them feel alive. Winking stars in the background make the rest of the "world" feel populated.
* Best animations are on interaction and completion. Selecting an item gives it an animated border. Completing a puzzle gives you a little star-shaped confetti explosion that really suits the style of the game.
* Bar at the top cunningly shows status. Grey bars slide down from off screen, and one by one fill in as you complete the colored puzzles.
