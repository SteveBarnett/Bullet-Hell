* Amazing graphics, (mostly) good voice acting, incredible sense of atmosphere.
* It gets a bit samey after a while. The landscape only varies a bit, and the action is very repetitive. Whatever the quest, it always comes down to shoot, shoot, shoot, then shoot some more.
* Nice way of nudging exploration and discovery of new locations: a feint marker appears on your compass if you're near a new place.
* The factions stuff is a bit ham-handed, especially the resolution of it. Feels rushed.
* The lack of serious role-playing or conversation choosing is a problem for me. The conversation options often aren't clear: it's not always possible to pick the option that matches your intent. There's no feeling that your choices make any meaningful difference to the world.
