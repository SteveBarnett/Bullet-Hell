* Cool mix of demonic and technological
* Very very stylish; great choice of music
* Glitching, ghosting
* Alternate realities overlaid on each other, flit between the two
* Words, instructions, laid on the world, movie credits style
* Living paintings: small bits of it moving slowly
* Flipped worlds
* Bob barbas: the best boss fight I have ever seen. Meta, inside the TV graphics, on the TV while boss narrates (he's a news anchor), the glitching, the TV effects.
* The animation is stunning: the way the world is built up and for down and reshaped
* Waves of bullet time during the car chase sequence are brilliant and resonant
* Dream like quality of broken pieces of cityscape floating around
