* Using tilt to move isn't good for quick reactions, precision, or fast movement
* The arrow firing doesn't work for rapid shots. The indirect aiming doesn't work so well in this action dynamic
* Sword & sworcery style art goes well with fantasy / fairy tale worlds
* Having the same dynamic, but from a different, fixed, location keeps interest
* Focus / bullet time / red eye is a fun mechanic
