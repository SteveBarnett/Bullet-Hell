* Very cute Ancient Rome Dungeons & Dragons styling and 8-bit graphics and chiptune-style music.
* Tutorial is not great. Does classic "everything up front" method: piece by piece, as needed is better.
* Good variations on battle hex grids and enemies. Great pacing: actions are easy and intuitive to do, so you can fire off a few turns in a row. Quick succession, or take it slow and plan a few moves ahead.
