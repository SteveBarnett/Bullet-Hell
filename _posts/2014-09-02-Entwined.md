* Physically uncomfortable to play: the game requires you to push outwards with both thumbs, continuously. Begins to ache after a few minutes.
* **Beautiful** visuals. The contrails and colours and lights are amazing.
* Not a lot of variation in mechanic over the levels. Looks very different, but feels very samey.
