* Clunky controls and movement.Tthings are hidden away and things don't have clear affordances. Keep finding things by accident.
* Permastates are great: makes everything a bit more scary. My home base is now surrounded by smoking cars :).
* It's not clear how to change things about your base. Or what that does. And why it's good.
* The "living" of the world is great, especially the way things go on while you're away. Playing the team, not the character, is interesting and well done.
