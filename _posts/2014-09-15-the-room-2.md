* Not quite as good as the first one, but still well worth a play.
* Great puzzles. Still feels fresh, new ideas.
* The (location) spreading out of the puzzles doesn't work so well. One of the best bits about the original was the compactness of the puzzle space: physically splitting it up isn't quite as fun.
* Going very interesting spaces with the story, and playing the magical / supernatural angle very well.
