* Hex boards are always fun.
* Pilot portraits are *creepy*. Disturbing to look at; makes it difficult to care when they crash behind enemy lines. :-/
* Sound effects get a bit annoying. Burst of plane engine sounds don't quite make sense, even though it's a turn-based game.
* Kinda dull. Lacks a convincing hook into the world.
