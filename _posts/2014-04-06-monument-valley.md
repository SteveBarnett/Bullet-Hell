* The best game I have played in months. An absolute joy to play. [Go buy it](http://appstore.com/monumentvalley)! (iOS only at time of writing)
* Incredibly beautiful. [They say that](http://ustwo.com/blog/monument-valley-out-now/) "we set out to create an interactive experience in which every screen is a piece of art worth hanging on a wall" and that is exactly what they've done.   The attention to detail on every piece of the landscape and the experience is amazing.
* Elements of Fez's geometrical trickery, M C Escher's art, and the spookiness, architecture, and myths of the world of Ico, but so much more than just a combination of those.
* Really excellent at broadening the world and the puzzles. The mechanic and the way you use it keeps adapting and updating: there's a new surprise in each level. The visual trickery that lets you solve puzzles will make your brain melt, in a good way.
* Excellent length: I played through it in a (long) day and it felt perfect. Every minute was fun, fresh, and new.
* Lovely sound design. Gentle ambient background music is complemented by rings, scrapes, and pings that feel spot on.
