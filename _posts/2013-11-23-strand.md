* Cool, pop art, aesthetic. Slightly over the top with circling animations, though.
* General mechanics are good (stretching, cutting), but the peg mechanic is brilliant. Feels just right.
* No sound on the version I played. Kind of weird.
* Finished puzzles are pleasingly Cthuloid. Or maybe Ameboid.
