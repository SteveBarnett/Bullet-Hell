* Lots of things in the game feel fluid: running, shoving, parkour, the driving, the moving between missions and roles.
* The combat is fairly simple, but fun. Very similar to the Batman Arkham games.
* The world feels busy, unlike many open world games. It still doesn't feel quite alive, though.
* The shops in the game offer food and drink that offer you longer term buffs. It's a very interesting mechanic that changes the way you play a bit: start every day with a herbal tea.
* The missions are great: varied, interesting, and fun to play.
