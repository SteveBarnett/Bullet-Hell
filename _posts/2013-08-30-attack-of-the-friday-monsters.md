* Using the control blob for old-style forward and turn feels counterintuitive
* TV town, themes, work really well with japanese, old time-y, feel
* Messages confusing: "episode started!" Did I end the previous one?
  * Some Episodes are more like achievements
* Having lots of people around adds life to a town
* map on the screen makes navigation way easier
  * But the icon of you on the map doesn't move in each area, so it can confusing
* Trains going by in those background make the place feel alive
* Having kids TV style narrator is slightly patronising, but generally cool.
