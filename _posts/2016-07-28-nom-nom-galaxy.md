* Heath Robinson contraptions with robots! Really, really, fun to build up your contraption and then sit back and watch it churn.
* The balance of some elements felt a little off. Each level is quite big and begs to be explored, but you need to hang around your factory quite a lot, especially early in each level.
* The tutorial levels didn't quite work for me. They set you up with the incorrect expectation that the way to play is to add lots of robots as soon as you can (but adding them slowly, carefully, gives you more success).
* Gorgeous, inventive, crazy worlds. The variety in plants, robots, and other things is incredible.
