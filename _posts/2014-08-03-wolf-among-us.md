* Telltale at the top of their game: the voice acting and art is amazing, and it's the most cinematic of their games yet. Great angles, shots, pans.
* Their particular brand of point-and-click-with-hotspots is really well suited to the noir / detective / investigation vibes.
* QTEs are still a bit meh, though: they still feel tacked on. The ones that work are button presses and stick directions. The ones that make you move the cursor around the screen, then hit a button aren't so good.
* Great story, very exciting. Good thing I have all five episodes ready to play. \o/
