* Very, very, good-looking. Sharp graphics and lovely visual design of the game's interfaces.
* Sloooow loading times and laggy interface. Everything feels soupy.
* Internet connect **required** to play, apparently. If you're in the middle of a mission and your connection craps out, it boots you out to the menu so you can reconnect to the internet. Not okay, EA.
