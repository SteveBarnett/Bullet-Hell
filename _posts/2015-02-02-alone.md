* Beautiful graphic design. Really atmospheric and exciting. 
* Difficult! Really classic hardcore twitch gaming. Never frustrating, though: like all good (high difficulty or skill-based games) games, you always feel like it was your fault you doused, and not the game's (the controls are sloppy or the collision detection is off).
* Very well judged "health bar." If you make a few mistakes in a row, you die. Otherwise, you mostly survive. 
* A much better version of [Fwip](http://fwip.co.za/) :)
