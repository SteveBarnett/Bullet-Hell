* Amazing graphics and voice acting. More like a playable movie than any other of Cage's earlier games - in a good way. A-list actors really help raise the bar of All The Things.
* About half of the QTEs are better than in other games: fewer strings of random buttons pushes and more pushing the stick in a direction that makes sense for the action. There are *a lot* of QTEs, but control of your character directly or indirectly isn't consistent, so that you're often not sure when you're supposed to be in control. This leads to you finding yourself standing still in the middle of a tense escape sequence because the rest of it has been QTEs.
* Great story, told in a non-linear way: you jump in and around Jodie's life. Great, modern sci-fi-like ideas and execution.
