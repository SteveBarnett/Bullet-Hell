* Cute idea: using the phone to encourage playing with friends in meatspace instead of all staring at your own screen. Unfortunately, games require you to use the screen a lot.
* Great idea to choose a place, then a number of people: get a game to match the resources available.
* The games aren't actually good, and you only get a handful with the app. The majority are available as In-App purchases. The balance makes the app feel stingy.
* Annoying, unnecessary and unnecessary frequent sound effects. **Every** tap, really?
