* Well named. :)
* Beautiful minimal graphics and music. A very delicate touch: only what's essential has been added.
* Great transitions between states. The screen shaking and fading to white for death is perfect: gives the feeling of G-Force taking over. The peephole zoom in of the ball, and the drop of the ball when you restart work well because they feel like they exist in the game world, rather than being a separate thing.
