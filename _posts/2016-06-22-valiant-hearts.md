* Stunning visuals. The cartoon-y, cross-hatched, art is beautiful, and animation is fantastic. Lovely layered, 2.5D, world that you jump and in out of in fun ways.
* Really good sound design. Music is used masterfully, and sound effects are used with expert effect.
* Simple, but fun and satisfying puzzles. Lots of clunking and lever pulling.
* Sobering reminders of the horrors and staggering loss of life in the war. Educational rather than depressing, though.
