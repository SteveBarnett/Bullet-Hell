* Classic point and click action with a bit of a twist for the (oh ho) modern age.
* Fantastic voice acting. Not a single bum note from any of the characters, and some sneaky guest appearances that you might take you a minute to pick up.
* Beautiful art, especially the animation: often felt like watching a big budget animated movie.
* A bit too easy to miss some key items that get you stuck later. A spolier-free walkthrough is recommended once you reach the beach.
* Really great world building. You learn a lot about from the things left unsaid, and from the backgrounds in locations.
