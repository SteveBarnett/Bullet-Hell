- Really amazing art: a nice big nudge away from business-as-usual. The people, the art, the architecture are all stunning.
- Tightly-packed levels. They're all small(ish) but very dense. It makes them feel like a little puzzle box. Always more to find in the nooks and crannies.
- Playing stealthy is very hard. Being spotted happens fairly easily, and escaping once you are is near impossible (partly due to the small levels).
