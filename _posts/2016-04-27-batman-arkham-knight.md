* So, so, pretty. The character models are incredibly detailed, and the city and its bits and pieces are beautiful.
* The batmobile is a good addition. For the first little while it feels a bit tacked-on, but then it starts to feel like an integral part of your utility belt.
* The earlier parts of the game feel a little loose and lost. There are plenty of side missions to do, but it's not clear where or how to get started with them. As you explore, you gather intel and things are a little more guided and helpful.
* A fitting end to the trilogy. Closes off the story and the evolution of the game mechanics nicely.
