* Very effective use of networked cameras and phones, especially as part of the intro.
* Great dystopian SciFi tech vibes: shades of Minority Report, The Matrix,  Elysium, Metal Gear Solid, 1984.
* Camera control (scan and pan) is a bit floppy. Needs more snap.
* Exploration is rewarded well, with interesting story tidbits and excellent voice acting.
* Hidden iOS game recommendations. *Very good* recommendations.
* Very clever "death" mechanic. Restart points are regularly placed, and are woven into the thread of the story. Restarts also echo back to the very start of the game.
