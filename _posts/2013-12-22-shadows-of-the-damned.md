* Amazing visual design. Unholy blending of demonology, Rock n Roll, and Day of the Dead aspects of Spanish culture (comes through in the music too).
* Great camerawork in cut scenes. Classic action movie tropes mixed up with some comic book panels.
* Attention to detail in all aspects of the game, even loading screens have had some time and effort put into them.
* Slo mo, zoomed in, headshots are very classy.
* Garcia's quippery and the back and forth with Johnson are well written and funny.
* Very effective at creating a nightmare-like scenario: trapped, helpless, scared.
