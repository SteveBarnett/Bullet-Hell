* Amazing world. Beatiful and wide and so much fun to just run around in. ALmost comically dangerous, though. You can get killed by a honey badger if you walk off the path to go and pick some flowers. Yes, really.
* A lot like Far Cry 3. Mostly that's a good thing, but at times it all feels a little too familiar.
* Progress feels a little uneven. You spend a small portion at the start of the game struggling to keep up with the bad guys. Then, if you do a bunch of side missions, you can suddenly become Rambo.
