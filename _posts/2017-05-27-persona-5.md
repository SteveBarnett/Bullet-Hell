- Really, really, great design and UI. The first RPG (J or otherwise) I've played that actually pays attention to the interface and tries to do something interesting with it (and succeeds). Pretty much all the others fall into the classic, boring, styles: the UI is there, but workhorse-y. In P5 it's actually fun to use.
- So much **fun** to play. The cyclical nature of the game and the metagame are sprinkled with enough variety to keep it fresh, but familiar enough to make it feel easy to sink lots of time into.
- So... very... long. For the first 70 hours I enjoyed it immensely. It felt quite breezy. But I hit a wall and, alas, couldn't finish it.
