* *Almost* really good voice acting. Quality is generally good, but occasionally a bit hammy; partly due to the script. Seemed to get better as the game progresses, but that could just be me.
* Networking and directing of conversations could do with a little finessing: order of clue reveals can be broken a bit.
* Great music. Very well matched to the tone of the game.
* Really clever and fun detective mechanics. Fill-in-the-blanks style sentences or pictures to complete from a small pool of items / words / characters. Keeps the challenges of figuring out the answer, but without being frustrating.
* Small touch puzzles are great. Slightly tricky, but fun.
* Great character and world design. Unique and distinct.
* During interrogations, used items (i.e. conversation branches) are greyed out. Clever, and surprising that more games don't do this.
