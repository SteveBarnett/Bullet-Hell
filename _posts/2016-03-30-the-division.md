* Forces you to play online, and *with people* (gasp!). Be aware of that before picking it up: I somehow wasn't. Story missions start tough enough that you it's not fun or realistic to complete them on your own. Later you can fly solo.
* A bit odd. The story is kind of interesting, but it doesn't match well with the Murder Simulator style gameplay. "Headshot" is the only conversation option.
* The player / character division in terms of UI and loot and things is too confused and cross-overy. The HUD screens are presented as real-world high-tech (character) stuff, but they often include player information too.
* Very, very, pretty, especially in terms of UI and HUD and maps and things. So... shiny...
* In summary: joyless grinding and loot admin.
