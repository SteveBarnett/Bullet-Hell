* No fighting. No enemies. No danger. Peaceful, pleasing, exploration.
* Beautiful landscape, and just my kind of post-apocalypse. Overgrown buildings, flooded world.
* Clever and atmospheric use of camera angles when doing a big / long climb.
* A little bit clunky in terms of gameplay mechanics and controls sometimes, but sailing is silky smooth and fun.
* Nice length: just enough world to explore and enjoy, without feeling like they're trying to squeeze something into every corner.
