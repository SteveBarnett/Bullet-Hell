* The sights and sounds make it very tense. The spotlighted section in the deep dark is very ominous, and the chirping crickets interrupted by gunshots, squeals, and growls work very well.
* The cartoony graphics make it kinda cute, but don't stop it from being scary: which is good.
* Bit of a one trick pony, but fun while it lasts.
