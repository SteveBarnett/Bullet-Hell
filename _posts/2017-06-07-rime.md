- The gameplay and visual influences are very clear. **Lots** of Journey. Plenty of  Okami, Zelda and Ico. Sprinkles of Prince of Persia and even Bioshock.
- Because of that, it starts out feeling a bit generic and derivative. It's definitely worth sticking with, though, as it really finds its own groove as the game progresses. It starts showing it's own unique flavour it terms of really compelling visuals, unusual puzzles, and an interesting story.
- The platforming is solid, but not amazing. The puzzles start simple, but get better and more interesting as the game goes on.
