* An excellent game, well worth your time. Deserves every award it has received.
* Really well balanced: the amount of papers you have on your desk; the people that should pass or fail; the difficulty curve.
* Excellent graphics that are just detailed enough, and very characterful.
* The only downside is replayability: dialogue is repeated and starts to get familiar.
