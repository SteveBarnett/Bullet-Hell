* Attention to detail is ace: the giggle as you put your pilot into the rocket, the crayons-on-cardboard launch console, the graph paper for the construction.
* Graphic is lovely, especially the rocket pilots and the aliens.
* The race through space is fun, but feels a bit out of place. It shows you the aliens you rescue and the planetoids you grab, but nothing is done with them.
* Very short term appeal (for adults!)
