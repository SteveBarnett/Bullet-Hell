* Incredible presentation. Art is beautiful, animation is cartoon snappy and bouncy, music is mariachawesome.
* Combat is a little confusing at first, but grappling and throwing mechanic is appropriate (luchador) and satisfying (one enemy sending a crowd tumbling).
* Skeletal / day of the dead enemies very charming.
* Cute and cunning nods to other games: Mario, Zelda, Castle Crashers.
* Enemies falling apart into bits is satisfying.
* Small, but fun, puzzles using the world switching mechanic.
* Fighting gets deeper as you progress: complicated combos, juggling.
* classic platform tropes played to the hilt.
