* I have a sick obsession with golf games. Hate actual golf, but love videogame golf.
* Fun, but way too over complicated. They've added too much extra stuff that just gets in the way of the simple pleasure of whacking a ball hard with a stick. Points system is overly complicated, especially given that a simple system already exists: number of hits to sink the ball.
