* So much fun, but can be quite harrowing to play. Trippy story-telling and nightmarish elements. Walking back through a building you've cleared is a bit haunting.
* Great retro stylings. Very finely judged retro graphics, with lots of bits of distortion, white noise, and glitching. Lots of movement in the interface.
* Fantastic soundtrack. Great electronica, mixes very well with the graphic style.
* Difficult, but done well. Speed and risk-taking is rewarded, and death isn't punished. Works to keep you trying again and again and get a good speed run through a level.
