* The infinite lives + randomised layout combo is very interesting. It keeps things fresh, and makes you excited to see what the game's going to throw at you next. The level generator is incredibly finely tuned: every level feels like it's been hand-crafted.
* Long, mostly unskippable, intro and attract sequence every time you start. Plays well in short bursts, so it should let you jump straight in away: you don't want to spend two of your ten minutes getting to the start of play.
* You die a lot, so it's important that deaths are fun: and they are. The animations and circumstances of death are often funny. The game over screen shows your journal, with a short instant replay of your death, and a line of two describing it: "I took an arrow to the chest" kind of thing.
* Lots of fun things cropping up that keep the laughs and challenges coming: gold idols to steal, shops to buy stuff, new monsters.
