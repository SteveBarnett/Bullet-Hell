* cute idea: animated diagrams of everyday things.
* puzzle pieces to out it together is good idea, but not implemented: piece snaps to the right place wherever you drop it. Would be better as learning puzzle?
* Play mode is too simplistic: hit a button, it does a thing. That is all.
* Play animation is a good idea, but animation is too simplistic to be cool. Too few frames.
