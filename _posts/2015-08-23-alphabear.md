* Very cute and playful imagery and feel. The occasional bear growling at you is especially cute.
* The Tripletown cobble-together-and-make-bigger mechanic works (surprisingly!) well with the addition of letters.
* Multiple "currencies" are confusing (but, to be fair, many games have a similar set up). It's not clear what does what.
* The in-App purchase mechanic reality grinds my gears. It's an example of the worst way of doing it. Time-locking things, making you buy game currency (but without a clear picture of what that will get you in game). I much prefer simple, content-based, IAPs: the game and the first few levels are free (essentially a demo), and you unlock the main game with one payment.
* After all that whinging, though, I find myself coming back to it a lot: it's great for a casual pick up and play for 15 minutes or so.
