* Classic damsel in distress trope, but let's you swap the roles and have Clive be the damsel.
* Very cute art style. Cartoon-y, sketch-y, and the wobbling makes it feel alive. Smooth animation makes it feel very polished.
* Great levels and bosses using classic old school platform shooter tropes, but with little twists.
* Very simple, limited, controls, but really puts them through their paces. Good example of how constraints can be beneficial, force you to think, and be creative.
