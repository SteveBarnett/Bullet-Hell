- Amazing.
- The sense of scale is incredible. Not just in the huge size of the (open) world, but in terms of the monsters, the bosses, the buildings, the places.
- Weapons break way too fast. But you get used to it and find a balance. Overall, the system is good, though. The complexity of most of the armour and weapons anf potions and stuff feels just right. The only thing that wobbled for me was food: I loved making it, but the balance of buffs to what I needed was a bit off. The first third I felt underbuffed, the rest overbuffed. Erm...
- Despite the many changes, it still **feels** like a Zelda game. It has the right, familiar, flavour at the core of it.
- A more mature, serious-feeling, story, despite it being told to you in tiny pieces.
- Horses! Training them is a bit of a pain, but riding them around is so much fun. Just trotting through a giant field, looking around, whacking the occasional moblin in the head, is lovely.
- **Side note:** The Switch as a machine is awesome. Very cute. The transformer-y-ness of it is much more fun than I expected.
