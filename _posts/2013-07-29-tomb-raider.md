* Great, realistic, jungle setting and abandoned village stuff.
* Short, but very cunning, tombs for raiding.
* They tried hard, and started well, with the whole "killing is hard and horrible" thing, but slipped into a bit of murder simulation as the game went on. It fell into the trap of making a game more challenging / interesting as it progresses by adding more bad guys.
* They tried to show Lara's progression from innocent to hardcore ("a survivor is born"), but it came across more like she went insane. At one point she responds to the guard's chit chat with a battle cry something like "I'm coming for you all!" Serial killger crazy, not just  a survivor trying to escape.
* Overall pretty cool, though, and some good climbing mechanics.
