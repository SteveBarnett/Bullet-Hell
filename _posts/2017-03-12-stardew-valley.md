- Charming AF. It's not exactly twee, but it's really cute and sweet.
- So wide in terms of choices. So deep in terms of the long game and the story and chatting to the villagers. The festivals add nice bursts of fun in-between long runs of churning.
- Pretty much a game of grinding, with tiny, infrequent, payoffs. There's a little repetition: just enough to keep you interested. And sometimes a peaceful rhythm, without much in the way of surprises, is exactly what you want.
- Gettings animals on the farm is surprisingly satisfying, compared to just having veggies.
