* Really great Cold War, angular art, style and setting. Posters and signs in the background set the scene nicely and provide shots of humour.
* Feels like the code wasn't optimised: loading screens seem to hang around for a while and (only on meta-game screens) it isn't as responsive to button presses as you'd like.
* Bit of a lackluster ending. Anti-climatic, didn't really do anything with the story built up in the cute interchanges during the cut scenes.
* Shades of [Rolling Thunder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Thunder_(video_game)). Ah, nostalgia.
