* Lavishly detailed world: architecture, alphabet, fashion. Really great flavour to it: a mashup of Blade Runner, French gothic, and steampunk elements.
* Cute animated storyboards for cut scenes: the camera zips and zaps and zoom around, giving it energy.
* Controlling gravity and flying around is great fun, but it's very staccato, and never feels fluid, especially in battles.
* Side missions have a couple of categories, but are very samey. The story missions are better, and well paced in terms of story.
* The map is surprisingly useful, given the stacked, levelled, 3D nature of the world. The direction marker, by contrast is not: it points directly at your target when sometimes you'll need to loop the long way round to get there.
