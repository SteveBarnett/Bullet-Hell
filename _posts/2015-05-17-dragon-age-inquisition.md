* Really great voice acting, but sketchy facial motion capture. Sometimes they look a bit like [Terrance and Phillip from South Park](http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Terrance_and_Phillip).
* Clever use of emotion markers on dialogue options: makes your intent clear. Other games where you can choose dialogue branches don't do this, so you can end up saying something that you didn't mean to. 
* Beautiful graphics. Seriously jaw-dropping landscapes.
* Massive, intricate, world that hangs together beatifully.
* Ridiculous typograpy choice for the main text. It's really tiny type, set in reading-unfriendly small caps. I have to pull the TV half way across the room to be able to read it! (Also, yes, I am old)
* A bit too long. After hitting 60 hours, I started to get fatigue: I kinda wanted it to be over. So I stopped being completionist and just ploughed on through the main story.
