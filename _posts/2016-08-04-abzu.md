* Like [Journey](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/) mixed with [Ecco the Dolphin](http://eccothedolphin.wikia.com/wiki/Ecco_The_Dolphin). (That's a compliment!) A beautiful audio visual experience that's about exploration and enjoying being in the world rather than ticking all the boxes and getting all the achievements.
* Lovely light touch on story. Enough bits and pieces for you to make something of it, but not spoon-fed exposition of "this means that. SEE?!".
* Felt a bit short for once-off. The world was lovely to be in, but I don't think I'll go back to it.
