* Great sense of claustrophobia when in a crowd of walkers. Camera angles and motion heighten the tightness, closeness.
* Terrible start to the experience. A couple of quick-easy-to-die sections in a row that depend on remembering the controls. Since the episodes are spaced out by lots of weeks this is bad!
* A bit too Lost-like. Ends on a cliff-hanger, but without much payoff during the episode.
