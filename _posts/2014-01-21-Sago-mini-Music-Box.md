* *Incredibly* cute.
* Short but sweet. Progression through each of the two stories is nicely paced, and changes just the right amount as you go through. Both end on a cute photo snapshot: a real "Awww" moment.
* More great UI and UX from Sago.
   * The CTA on the home page pulsates gently.
   * You can touch anywhere on the screen and it will do something, but that something changes throughout the story; when it changes, one example pops out, so you tap it, and learn the new thing.
   * You have to tap to start the story. The landing page shows a hill with something just about poking out from behind it.
   * Tapped things are made obvious: they bounce, or big things animate and jump around.
   * Only two story choices. Uncomplicated.
