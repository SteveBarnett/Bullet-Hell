* Simple, intuitive, interface. Explanations seem unnecessary.
* Not an interesting experience. It feels like they've removed the core of a game and just left the controls. Makes it feel like practicing something (doing a kata, or rehearsing your lines for a play) rather than playing a game. Like playing a driving game where they only show the inside of a car, not the road that you're on.
* Well-paced and prompted: speed and animation work well to keep you going.
