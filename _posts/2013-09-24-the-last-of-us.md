   * Contextual actions: kills using the environment
   * Amazing voice acting, characterization
   * Beautiful, crazy detailed, environments
   * Overrun, overgrown, post apocalyptic world is really well realised
   * Nice subtle HUD iconography
   * Scary!
   * Show, don't tell: posters, graffiti; actions and conversation of NPCs
   * Darkening of screen, slowed movement, blurred vision, muffled sound, when mortally injured
   * Visual effects of hard snowing scenes
   * Deep, flawed, character of Joel
   * Brave and intersting to set the game over a long time period
