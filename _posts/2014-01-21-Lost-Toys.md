* Gorgeous graphics and lovely soundtrack, and sound effects. Very similar in slickness to Zen Bound.
* Transformers toy style puzzling (rotating along various axes) should be perfect for touch screens, but doesn't always quite catch right. Often end up rotating the view rather than the piece of the toy.
* Filling a grey world with colour is very satisfying.
