* Why have I just discovered this now? It is amazing.
* Crappy 8bit pixel art that's made great by:
    * animation: things seem alive because of constant movement. Fast moving backgrounds.
    * camera work. You see a long shot of each level, then zoom in for the action, then zoom out for the finale.
    * a lot of character (and characters). Devastating explosions.
* Original mechanic: Save The Day played on fast, short cycle, repeat. Lots to trys in each slice, so it doesn't get dull, but you only get one shot per slice per round.
* Wildly (and often perplexingly) original level design
