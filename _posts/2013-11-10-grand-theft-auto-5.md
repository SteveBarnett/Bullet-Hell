* Very slick interfaces. Feels like a big improvement over previous games in the series.
* Great transitions: night to day and vice versa; character swapping.
* Strong narrative flow, despite switching between characters. You pick up on them just as they're finishing an action (having a cigarette at the beach, waking up half-naked on a rooftop), so there's a feeling of onward motion.
* Instructions for things are often displayed on screen at inconvenient times, e.g. the first time you take part in a race.
* Great sense of humour throughtout. My person favourite, from Trevor regarding Rednecks: "The politically correct term is rural Americans."
* The whole world is feels very much alive: from the way your houses and the insides change, to the people on the street.
* Guilty of severe Alertus Interruptus. The action freezes and the screen fills with a warning that you're about to overwrite a save game. Warning you about overwriting a save is good, but better to just save to a new slot than interrupt the flow, or create a temp save and ask later?
* The character switching works great when in open world mode. During a mission: not so much.
* Extreme sports side missions are really fun, and show off the game engine and world well.
