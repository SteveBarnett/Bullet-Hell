* Amazing art, design, and animation. Subtle, small, animations add character and life to the interface and the metagame screens.
* Unusual, but very appealing, travel system. Mix of watching short cinematics and random encounters of either conversations or battles.
* Fantastic world-building and story: the banners, the godstones, the, um,  world.
* Ends on a *massive* spoiler. Which I was not expecting and am a bit angry about.
