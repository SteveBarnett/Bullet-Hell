* Stunning production values. Beautiful, smooth, visuals and excellent sound design.
* Brilliant at playing with scale, location, direction, destruction of scenery, and re-appropriation. Takes the core mechanic and really puts it through its paces.
* Upgrades and achievements well paced. Skillful play (and replay) of the game is rewarded, rather than the usual arbitrary "do this thing three times" criteria.
* Very well sized. Long enough to feel like you've seen a lot, but doesn't feel needlessly stretched out.
* Unfortunately suffers from classic "sticks on screen" problem: some levels demand high precision that the controls can't supply, so it ends up being more luck than skill (and sometimes frustrating).
