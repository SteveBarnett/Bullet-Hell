* Lovely understated graphics. Could do with better / more complex zooming controls, though. The zoom level never feels quite right, and you can't change it, only temporarily zoom in or out.
* Cute courses. Like putt putt designed by a geometry teacher. 
* Bad sound. Too short, sharp, and harsh. For an ongoing, infinite, roll like this, it feels like a more peaceful, strumming chords, kind of sound effect system would work better.
