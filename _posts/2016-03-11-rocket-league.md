* A hi-octane thrill ride of the ZOMG kind. Lots of fun to pick up for a few quick matches in between doing other things.
* You never quite feel like you're in control. The cars are very responsive and nippy, but control of the ball always feels very indirect, almost accidental at times.
* There a few cheap tricks that kinda take the fun out of it (and because of the point above, you find yourself using them), mostly to do with scoring a goal at kick-off. Kind of fun getting that optimised though, and a bunch of goals in quick succession.
