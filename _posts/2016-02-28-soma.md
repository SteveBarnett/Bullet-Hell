* Scary as **hell**. Uses some classic jump-scare tactics that really work to keep you on edge. Great sound design that ties in to this.
* Strangely balanced interactivity of objects. Lots and lots of things can be interacted with but most of them are pick up, look at, put down. Very few are actually usable.
* Interesting sci-fi story (robots! consciousness!), but it mostly resolves about a third of the way through the game.
* Less than great wayfinding and no map means you can spend a lot of time feeling lost, and some time running in circles.
