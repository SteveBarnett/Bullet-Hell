* Incredible, beautiful, art style. Cel-shaded, chiascuro, sketches.
* Trippy world and story. Great near-future cyberpunk vibes. Illusory. Dreamy, disorienting, delusional. Cool cinematic switching of viewpoints and camera angles.
* The action is a little bit dull and repetitive.
* Very dodgy. Tries to get away with it by being "cool" and tongue-in-cheek, but does quite manage it.
