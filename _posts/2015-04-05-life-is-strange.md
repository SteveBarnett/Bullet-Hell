* Wide, rich, environments compared to other recent point and click adventures.
* Nice, player-friendly, take on the time-travel mechanic: let's you skip already-seen sections quickly and easily.
* Lovely, charming, art style: sketches and paper and post-its and scribbles.
* Okay animation, but it's pulled along by great voice acting and (mostly) great scripting.
