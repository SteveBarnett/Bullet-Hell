- The Mario + Rabbids combo works. Surprisingly! It's mostly the rabbids dorks hanging out in Mario's world, and they kinda fit.
- Very well designed gated release of features and options and things, via do-it-and-learn-it tutorial. (Big up front "tours" of things tend not to work: people forget most of the stuff because it's too much in one go and it's passive consumption of information)
- At a Goldilocks place in the line from simple to complex for the mechanics and the skill tree. Not so simple that it's dull and not too complex that it's WTF.
