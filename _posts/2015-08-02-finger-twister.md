* Fun! The spinner is great and is very wheel-of-fortune-gameshow cool. That and the highlighting of the target row mean that it's clear, even without reading the instructions, how to play.
* When do you read the instructions, they're a little odd. The tone is a bit technical and serious compared to the fun / silly nature of the game. Some just-in-time instructions (on a first play-through, or a demo session) might be better.
* Well-timed bouts of action. Great for a pick up and play a few rounds break.
* Violation is a bit of an odd word to use. Something less... threatening... like "Nope!" or "Doh!" might be nicer.
* Your view of the HandRing spinner block at the bottom is often blocked by your own hand, especially when you're using three fingers, making it hard to see what your next move is suppoed to be. Moving it to the top of the screen would make sure it's always visible.
* Does not work well on my Samsung E250. :troll:

### Disclaimers/ points to note

* I know the game designer / developer well.
* This review was written with more of a critical eye than other Bullet Hell reviews because I want to provide feedback to the designer / developer.
* This game was written over just one weekend! Yoinks!
