* Interesting and original idea: grow the plant all the way up.
* Collision detection can be a bit wonky, which results in missing your jump / glide and falling down a long way. Combine that with slow progress up the trunk, and you can sometimes have periods of very frustrating play.
* Lovely scenery and graphics. Full of character and personality.
* Good length. Just long enough to explore the ideas that it wants to, and show you it's lovely world.
