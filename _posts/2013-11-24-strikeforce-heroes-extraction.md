* Feels styled like an endless runner, but is actually more of a platformer on rails. The cover mechanic breaks the fun of the running a bit.
* UI is a bit clunky. Icons aren't clear, text is too small in places.
* Ending sequence of each level is classic trope stuff: feels good!
* Jumping feels a little heavy, especially compared to similar games like Canabalt.
* Flaws and Perks system is cunning and original. Each character starts with a Flaw, but you can unlock Perks as you play.
