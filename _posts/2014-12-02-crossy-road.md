* Fun! Modern twist on Frogger: retro isometric 3D graphics, endless runner. Better than the unfinished [gatjie]() :). 
* Great sound effects.
* Great character work on the vehicles, especially the high speed train that comically whizzes through the screen every now and then.
* Unfortunately, IAP nagging for avatar upgrades grates quickly.
