* On the demo, there were *two* door slams prompting to buy the game before actually being able to play it!. They contained special offers, but were very still very annoying.
* Cheesy music and graphics for the interface really hit the spot. Really like being in the 80s again.
* The magical notebook for stats / menus is *ace*. Chunky, crappy, cheesy, and a clever use of in-game stuff for meta-data.
