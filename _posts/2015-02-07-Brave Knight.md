* Beautiful, haunting, story, helped by Great soundtrack and well played graphic: not fancy, but well structured and placed.
* You play by drawing letters, but the character recognition isn't great, and it breaks the flow of the story when you "fail." It might be better to just keep going even when the player makes a mistake: the story (the most important thing in this piece) keeps flowing.
