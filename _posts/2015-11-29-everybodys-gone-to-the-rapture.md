* Stunning production values. An absolute feast for the eyes and ears.
* The main "listen to people's conversations" mechanic is nice, and makes for some very powerful story moments. Since there's no map and no checklist (both of which are plus points!), it can be easy to miss some of the conversations, though.
* The story is really great. The main thread is unravelled at a fairly leisurely pace, but the side threads are so beautifully done that you mostly won't mind.
