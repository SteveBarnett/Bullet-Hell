* Unlike anything you've played before. Original, clever, and constantly creative.
* Breath-taking to look at and play. Minimal art style with geometric, but not sharp, edges.
* Great use of colour to indicate activity and interactivity.
* Sometimes a little too terse in its hints: can leave you scratching your head and not quite figuring out where to go or how to get there.
