* Incredible, amazing, jaw-dropping size and scope. The immersiveness of "get into spaceship - fly off planet - fly to next planet - land" without loading screens or breaks is really great.
* Becomes samey after a while. The grinding (for materials for crafting) is a little monotonous, but there's a calm peace to it, like mining in Minecraft. That's okay. What's less pleasing is that the planets start feel quite samey. The fauna can be quite different between planets (sometimes cool, sometimes "what the junk is *that*?"), but the flora starts to look very alike ("oh, a *slightly thicker-trunked* cactus thing").
* Bugs. So many bugs. It's great that the team is releasing patches, but for me it's a bit too late. I almost gave up on the game several times. Most of my bugs were being stuck in my ship and not being able to move or get out of it.
* Bitterly disappointing "endings" (#nospoilers!). I get that (and love that) it's mostly a game about exploration and discovery. But if your players *do have quests to do*, and it takes a lot of time and effort to do them, they should be rewarded with something, not just a little fizzle.
* I think it lives up to the hype of delivering a massive space exploration game. It doesn't deliver much more than that, though, so it's not a game to play for months on end.
