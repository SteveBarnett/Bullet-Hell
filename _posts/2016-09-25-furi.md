- So, so, difficult. Always fair, though. You never die because the controls weren't responsive enough: it's always the player's fault. I only got about 1/3 of the way through. I loved the challenge, but didn't have the patience to persist. Almost made me think I might be ready to play Bloodborne, though.
- Very slick, cool, characters and level and world designs. Sharp anim√© edges.
- Interesting take on leveling up and XP. You don't gain skills as you work through the game. The leveling up is personal: it's your understanding and skill at using them that upgrades.
