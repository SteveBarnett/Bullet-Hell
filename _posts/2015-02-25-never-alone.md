* Beautiful and evocative art, especially the spirits.
* Frustrating and annoying gameplay. Lots of little things (responsiveness, use of weapons, instakills) that add up to not a fun experience.
* Interesting idea around unlocking cultural insights instead of achievements, but presentation of them was a bit underwhelming.
