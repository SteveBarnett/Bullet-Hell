* Very accomplished presentation: great animation and general slickness. Cool anime.
* Fighting is a little dull. It uses the classic "stick and buttons on the screen" control method, and (like everywhere else) it doesn't really work. The pace of fights is a little slower than classics like Street Fighter and Tekken, so the touch input feels well matched there, though.
* Nice story, but nothing that really shines with originality. Like the fighting, it feels a little by the numbers.
