* Great graphic design. The combinations of the simple geometric shapes and motifs work well.
* The animations, transitions, and drop shadows make the scene feel really alive and bubbling. Very smooth and delicious.
* Cute tutorials: lots of character, humour.
* Feels like its lacking something: more narrative?
