* Argh! Can't play offline. At all. That is stupid.
* I'm a sucker for Japanese theming: sliding doors to transition between screens is cool.
* Using the speed-up-construction in the first tutorial is clever: you learn he mechanic, and it doesn't slow down the progression through the tutorial, into the game proper.
