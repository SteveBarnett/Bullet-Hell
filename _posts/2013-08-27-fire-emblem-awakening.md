* Even though fighting mechanic is fun, and story is engaging, the combat gets very samey after a lot of hours.
* relationships mechanic is great
  * chit chat in barracks adds lots of flavour
  * levelling up to marriage is fun
  * showing of relationship level when choosing where to move a character is great
* power triangle is simple but so powerful
  * tweaks on it are great: horses, pegasii
