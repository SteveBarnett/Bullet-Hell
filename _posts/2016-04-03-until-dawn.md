* So much to love about this game. The production values are amazing, and the game is exceptionally atmospheric. The graphics are good enough to feel like we're breaking out of the uncanny valley, the sound is excellent, the camera angles are beautifully chosen, the voice acting is great, the weather effects are very convincing.
* The QTEs sometimes feel a little too unannounced, and don't feel like they add too much to the game. The choices, especially the Butterfly Effect ones, feel great, though.
* Does groovy things with light and shadow. Great torches. Seriously, most games get them really badly wrong.
* Excellent story and story-telling. It starts a little slow, but really ramps up and pulls together lots of different threads well.
