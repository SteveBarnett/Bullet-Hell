* Groovy intro, SciFi set up. Cute story.
* Very detailed graphics on the units, but you don't really get a chance to see them up close enough to appreciate it.
* Tutorial is quite well-paced, but because of the pay-to-speed-up nature of the game, feels like it's priming you for In-App purchases. Another push towards that is that you can only build one thing at a time... unless you pay!
* Battle sequences are fun. Pew pew!
