* Incredible open world. Just the right balance of story missions and side missions (not too many of them, they are something interesting and relevant).
* Great secondary strategy game of keeping Mother Base going. Simple on the surface, but more complicated the deeper you go. Does end up feeling a little without-impact-y, though.
* The usual, somewhat pleasing, batshit-insane storyline, courtesy of director Hideo Kojima.
* Seriously lacks pace in the extended epilogue. The main story arc ends very dramatically, leaving many threads unresolved. Then, you have to hang around and wait for the next story mission to surface. It would have been much more happy-making to be able to blitz through the final few missions.
