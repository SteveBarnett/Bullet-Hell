* All based around the slightly disturbing principle that you should keep waking up your animals so that the visitors are entertained. Feels a bit... uncomfortable. Especially since capturing animals for your zoo is "rescuing" them (from a green, luscious, field).
* The rescuing is a bit too random to be rewarding: essentially like Battleships, but with limited moves.
* Some nice navigation / streamlining ideas. Animals pens are in a line horizontally. Get to the far end, and there's a button that sends you all the way back to the start of the line to rescue animals: shortcut so that you don't have to scroll, scroll, scroll. Also, in-game
notifications appear as big buttons; tapping them takes you to the action spot so you can immediately fix the problem.
