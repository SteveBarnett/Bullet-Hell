* Beautiful, engaging, interesting world. Riding around at sunrise or sunset is a real feast for the eyes. The characters are well scripted and well acted.
* Terrible UX in the menu systems. There are lots and lots of options and categories, but moving between with a controller is fiddly and annoying (perhaps designed with a mouse user in mind?). Comparing items (what you have, what they have, what you can craft (and whether you have the supplies to craft it or not)) can be a real head-scratcher.
* Very, very, long. That's a plus and a minus. I settled in to the fairly gentle pace of the main storyline and enjoyed it, despite being a little underwhelmed by the finale, which felt a little rushed and under-explained.
* An open world game that does side missions really well (for a change). They're varied in nature and length, and more often than not involve talking to people to sort things out, and using your medieval Batman skills (rather than just collected another five animal pelts).
* Not nearly as dodgy (in terms of gender issues) as The Internet lead me to believe, but a few eyebrow raisers along the way.
