* "My lightning, my prayer." Interesting (and confusing) world and inhabitants. Really enjoyed it without quite understanding it. Cool meta-story.
* Beautiful art and camera work. Pixel art, but softer.
* Controls a bit crappy and clunky, even for basic moving around.
* Old school computer font, oversized, is cool, and fits the vibe, but is hard to read on a big screen when it's over multiple lines. Readability should be first, coolness second.
* Tron-like moments and story. Excellent.
