* Bit of a weird mix in terms of interaction with the world. The Parkour stuff works pretty great most of the time. The more precise, fiddly, bits don't work so well: there's little guidance on what's climbable or not, so it ends up being trial and error.
* Far too easy to die, even once you beef up. If you miss one zombie behind and get munched on once or twice, you're done.
* Great day and night cycle, and cute idea to boost your stats during the night and give you big XP bonuses for surviving.
* A bit too generic and trope-hit-y. Poor man's Far Cry, with zombies and parkour.
