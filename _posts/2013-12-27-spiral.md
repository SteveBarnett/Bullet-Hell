* Interesting take on Point and Click: full 3D using the Unreal engine.
* Strangely variable quality: the world and characters are great, detailed, well lit; the voice acting and music is good; the menus and UI look sloppy and amateurish by comparison; the font for the in-game text is all squiffy.
* Good controls. Walking about is okay, but combat is nippy and responsive.
