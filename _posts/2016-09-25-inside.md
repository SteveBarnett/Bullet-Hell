- The most atmospheric, creepy, exciting, scary, game I have played in a long time, expertly and amazingly executed. The use of light and shadow, things happening in the background, the sense of depth and scale, the sound design: brilliant in every aspect.
- A bit odd in terms of challenge. It's a bit too easy to die, especially when finding new things. It's not clear what to do, so you try a few different things. But all of them kill you. Eventually you find the thing that works, and you do it. You don't get punished at all for failures, though, so it never feels too bad.
- Excellent length and pace. You're always discovering new things and the story is told in exactly the amount of time it needs. A rare occurrence!
- Creepy. Seriously, it's worth saying it again.
