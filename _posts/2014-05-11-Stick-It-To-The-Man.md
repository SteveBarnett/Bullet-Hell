* Like an acid-fueled combination of Tearaway, Psychonauts, and Adventure Time.
* Beautiful, crazy, art. Excellent music and busy, bustling, sound design.
*  Incredibly good voice acting, and amazing script (courtesy of genius-person [Ryan North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_North)).
* Very light platforming action that's really just to let you get around the levels. Fun to run around and jump on / over / through things, but the pseudo-puzzle sections getting through the gaurds / agents pails a little over the course of the game.
* The tactility of tearing things of and slapping them down on to other things is great. Rip, slap!
