* Very high end graphics
    * But tiny text and way too much stuff on screen at phone size
* Suffers from usual tilt to steer problems
* Loading screen could be cuter
* Sci fi font looks cool, but isn't very easy to read
* Water splashes on the camera are good for pulling you in
* Rag doll physics on human bodies are satisfying to watch tumble.
