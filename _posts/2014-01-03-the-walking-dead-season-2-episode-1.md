* Great audio visuals: cool art style, accomplished camera work.
* Compelling, visceral, hard,  and horrible storyline, just like the TV show.
* Action sequences aren't as tight as Season 1: controls a little looser, and more frequent. (and therefore annoying) one hit kills.
* Clementine starts as a less appealing and capable character, but gets better quickly.
