- Absolutely beautiful post-apocalyptic landscapes. **I want to go there.**
- Really great combat mechanics. The chip system for buffs and things is really groovy, especially dipping into using the auto ones now and again. The extra hacking mini-shmup bits are a fun addition.
- Toooooo long. The story progresses along quite slowly and the combat and running around starts to feel samey. Especially when the quick travel shortcuts keep getting disabled for "story reasons."
- Really great sci-fi story, but it's hard to get at all the pieces. You have to really explore every nook and cranny to get the most out of it.
- The 26 endings thing is a bit of a gimmick. The main 5 endings are more like 4 chapters of the game that you play in sequence. The second ending is really just replaying the game with a few little extra pieces.
