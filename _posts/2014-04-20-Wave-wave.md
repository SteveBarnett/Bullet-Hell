* Ouch! The most headache-inducing game I have ever played. The combination of the glitching, spinning, and scaling of the play area and the hard and fast music is quite amazing.
* Tutorial is nice and short, and introduces you to the mechanic easily.
* Even the first few minutes of play are very difficult. A little bit of getting used to the rhythm  would have better.
