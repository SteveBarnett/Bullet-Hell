* Gorgeous graphics, especially in terms of scale. The height of each level is great, and the sense of epic-ness is really well communicated. The meta-game art and level handling is great and works really well.
* Combat is simple, but fun, especially as you level up.
* Varying and inconsistent levels of ham in the script and voice acting. Sometimes it's very hammy, and it works well. Other times it doesn't embrace full ham, and feels a bit odd for it.
* Subsequent replays are still fun, but drag on a bit. The sword upgrades provide some shortcuts, but by the third and fourth playthroughs, you want something a bit quicker.
