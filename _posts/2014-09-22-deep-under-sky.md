* Great ambient music. Well suited to the world, the pace of play.
* Unusual, unintuitive choice of some controls. Tapping anywhere on the screen pauses, but you have to tap on a tiny, fiddly bit to resume. The main controls, by comparison, are squirreled away in the corner.
* Beautiful, original, art. Feels very alien / deep sea, and very alive.
*  New take on the slingshot mechanic: baby / pollen spreading. Cool, if a little creepy.
