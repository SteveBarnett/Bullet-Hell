* Amazing in almost every way, and a worthy follow up to Jetpack Joyride. I like it a lot.
* Great wrapping of the game proper: the live streaming news report is perfectly pitched, and the shouty General is a classic.
* Lovely graphics: retro, cartoony, style with hand-drawn explosions.
* Excellent control system and central game mechanic: the adding of modules to Colossatron, the snapping into place, feels just right and has a satisfying ker-thunk sound effect; the combining of colours (or avoiding same) is clever and cunning; quite deep strategic play in the choosing of managing the length and structure of your beast, despite the crazy hectic feel of *action*.
* Interesting and original idea. A bullet hell where you don't dodge the bullets, and your craft is a constantly evolving puzzle.
* A nice twist on the invading monster from space trope: you play the monster.
