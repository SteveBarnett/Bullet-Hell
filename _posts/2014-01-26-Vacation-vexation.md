* Cute graphics. Simple, blocky, art style, but with touches of class. Very characterful animation, and does a lot with a little.
* Nice and simple, trimmed down, controls. No huge inventory, pages of stats, or using every button on the controller because you can: the game just uses what it needs.
* Charming little world.
