* Beautiful, inventive and original, character design
* Intuitive interface: drag and drop implied by empty pedestals. No tutorials or help text!
* Lots of fun. Very joyful.
* No record option, so creations are ephemeral. Would be nice to save a minute or two of a burst, maybe share.
* Limited long term appeal, but that fits the kid / toy market well?
