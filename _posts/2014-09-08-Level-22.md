* Really lovely retro pixel art, with a slightly Saturday morning cartoons feeling.
* Game mechanic is a little clunky. It's all about stealth and sneaking, but: you can't change the zoom of the level, so viewing ahead is awkward; getting spotted is instadeath, so it means restarting the level.
* Dialogue is cute: funny and The Office / Office Space-like.
