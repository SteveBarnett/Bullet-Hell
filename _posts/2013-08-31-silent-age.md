* Rain adds atmosphere
* Highlighting where you tapped can be useful
* Wordless single frame story boards are very effective
* Subtle parallax adds depth well
* Switching between time zones is fun. Could be more fun with more zones / universes. Think Charlie Jade.
* 70s setting is very well realised.
* Episodic content is cool, but each episode must have an arc. This one felt a little Lost-like: no big reveals or story content in the second half.
