* Turn-based strategy works surprising well in 2D! They do cunning things with the floors, bullet ricochets, entrance points, and free-aiming that make it feel just as complex and intense as a 3D version.
* Very appealing and interesting characters, and I love the Steambot Wild West in space theme.
* Very well judged length and depth: about 15 hours, 3 chapters of content, nice range of gear. Enough stuff and levels to feel like exploring them all, but without getting boring or repetitive.
