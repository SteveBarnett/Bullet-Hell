* Art style seems a bit confused. It can't decide whether it wants to be flag or not, whether it wants to all bright primary colors or not. And what's with the little colour stripe at the bottom of the screen?
* Breaks basic maths! Makes you do a mental double take for each move you make, and (as a mathematician in a previous life) makes me angry! Example: combining two 2 blocks gives you a 3. Argh!
* animations are great. Little wobbles and bounces add character to what could otherwise be quite a sterile environment.
