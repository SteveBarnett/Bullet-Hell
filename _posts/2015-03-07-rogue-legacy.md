* Like Spelunky Lite. Especially in that it's not quite as punishingly difficult.
* The family tree / legacy angle is cute and works well. Getting a slightly different character each time keeps in fresh. And the background descriptions are often LOL-worthy.
* Levelling up via your manor is an interesting twist. Would have been nice to have a little guidance / reveal as to where each branch goes. Levelling up feels a little slow.
