* Shooting stuff is fun. The hold and drag to lock, then release method works well.
  * Has this been used much in iOS games?
* Story idea is cool: you are the president, their duty is to pilot the Liberator and save the city.
* News flashes (via ticker) round out the world and story well.
* The way the aliens have classifications (lesser spike, greater spike)
* The purification theme: things go green, leafy, when purified.
* Deep story is revealed as unlockables.
* Controls aren't great. Strafing (hold L shoulder, use stick) is physically hard to do while also using the touchscreen!
