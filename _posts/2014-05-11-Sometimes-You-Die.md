* Well matched music. Kinda industrial and techy and harsh.
* Fun puzzle platforming, using an interesting twist: when you die, your avatar becomes a block, part of the scenery. Leads to some funny bits where you're repeatedly throwing yourself against a buzzsaw to make a platform to climb up.
* An interesting discussion on the structure and tropes of games via the narrator, but could have been more in-depth to make it more interesting: stronger opinions.
