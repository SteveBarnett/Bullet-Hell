* Interesting idea: making a game very close to an actual table top experience with a GM, miniatures, dice rolling and all. Although they're playful with the miniatures idea and great as posing them in shots, it doesn't quite work: it feels stilted and like they've tried to save on animation costs.
* The narration feels dorky and overblown at first, but you get into it quite quickly.
* Maps, stats, combat, and equipment are all great. A proper role playing experience.
* Dice-rolling looks great, but is pointless. You aren't told if you're rolling high or low, what your target is, what the possible outcomes are. You roll, then are told the outcome of your roll.
