* Cowboy steam punk miner theme is cool
* Fatal UX flaw: controls at bottom if screen, so exactly blocks your view of upcoming stuff.
* Very responsive, reactive, controls.
* Contradicts its own works a bit: mining, digging down through dirt. But some sections open out on to mines tracks, and there are Mario style fire spinners that don't make physical sense in the packed dirt world.
