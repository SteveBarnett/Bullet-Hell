* Amazing environment, wonderful to behold: the gentle bobbing of the islands; the slotting together and apart; the skylines and zipping along them; the incredible lighting.
* Wish they had done more with skylines: used them for longer, bigger movement than just bouncing around within an area.
* Exciting and constantly evolving SciFi storyline full of twists and turns and cool ideas. Lots of fun, but a little bit conflicty / inconsistent near the end.
* Vigours (magic) are fun. Make you feel like a superhero. Kinda weird that basically no one else in the world seems to use them, though.
* Elizabeth as a companion works well. She makes smart choices and helps out at the right times. Although she becomes extremely powerful, she gets damseled a few times, which feels a bit odd.
