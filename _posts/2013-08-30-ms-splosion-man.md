* Animation on loading screens is good. Makes perceived loading time faster.
* Tutorial videos can work if done well.
  * Use of characters helps
  * Showing the right way and the wrong way helps

* Freeze framing to highlight a boss weak spot is cool
* Controls are still classic left and right in dpad.
* Explode fur jump is a gimmick, but a cool one.
