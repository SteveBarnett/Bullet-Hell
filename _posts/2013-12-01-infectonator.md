* Brilliant retro vibes. Beautiful (and gross (zombie)) pixel art, fun chiptunes.
* Well balanced leveling up. Not much grinding is required, and it's fun doing it. The costs of upgrades feel well chosen.
* The little touches of internationalisation make a (surprisingly big) difference. Having the humans run around screaming in their local tongue feels special.
* Map is great: communicates the spread of the infection well.
