* Instructions page for grow ups is the worst of the UX. Separate page loads with no feedback on progress. Text is tiny and bunched.
* Simple top and bottom halves interface works well. Being able to swap using picture or text block is good.
* Pictures are well done and the halving works really well. Halving the name and text: not so much. Simple formula (first letter of one, remainder from other) is a bit predictable and dull, and text descriptions (although very cute), don't quite gel. Fine for kids, though?
