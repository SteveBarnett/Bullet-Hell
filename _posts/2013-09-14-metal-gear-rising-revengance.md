* Battle is complicated. Tutorial doesn't explain it well: not all the bits. Some things are prompted, but suddenly they disappear.
* Losing the first boss battle feels weird. Not expected of explained. Feels like you're doing something wrong.
* Fast, cyborg, ninja feels fun. But very light touch.
* Cool tech stuff, as per usual for the series: floating vid screens HUD style. Augmented reality overlays.
* Bad guy Sam projects himself sequentially across many screens in a town square
* Brains plot is funny
* Bodyworks style slices of stuff is cool: seeing the insides
* Cut scenes are a more sensible length than rest of series
* Hulk-like final boss is a bit dull, tired. Bad guys team isn't as cohesive, team like, as previous games in series
