* Another winner from Toca Boca. Cute, simple, no need for tutorials to figure out what's going on, great characters and design.
* More like a game than the others in the series: you fill up the periodic table by competing experiments on the elements / critters.
* I don't think that the mix of fact and fiction works: it bothers me. Real elements (and the periodic table) are used, and real scientific bits and bobs (centrifuge, Bunsen burner), but the chemical reactions are made up. From their *For Parents* page: "While the periodic table in Toca Lab is accurate, the way new elements are created is not."  I understand their choice, but I'm not sure it was the right one.
