* Very shiny intro sequence, but is a good example of how the game is trying too hard: it's **deep** now, and has a **serious sci-fi story** (where the first game was just cool).
* Tutorials are a bit thick and heavy-handed.
* Pretty much more of the same as Anomaly. I was hoping for more twists on the formula.
