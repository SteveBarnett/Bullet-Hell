* Very high production values
* Bit like angry birds, but with light sources. Done already, though?
* Text free Storyboard intro is cute, sets scene well.
* Not clear when a level ends, or how your star rating was determined.
* Throwing things about to smash stuff up is satisfying. Good physics engine.
