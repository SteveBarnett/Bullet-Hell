* Great tutorial style. Tuts came spaced out, as you need them, and for one action at a time. An overlay modal comes up with one line of instruction, and pictures of the buttons you need to press. Once you've pressed a button, it disappears. Once you've pressed them all, the modal disappears.
* Beautiful autumnal, sunset, colour palette. Warm fuzzy feeling about the world and its inhabitants. The viewing spot benches are well worth stopping for: they give you framed long and wide shots of the world, on top of what you see as you make your way through the world.
* The brothers have got great personalities that show up in their (non-verbal) interactions with others in the world.
* Things that you can interact with aren't highlighted in any way, so puzzle solving is sometimes a spray-and-pray of button clicks.
* The dual stick control system (one for each brother) is interesting, but doesn't quite work. It occasionally shines for specific tasks, though: when you have to do near-identical, timed jumps / grabs.
* The world reveals itself to be more magical and fey than you at first think. And quite a lot darker too. The ending / epilogue is gut-wrenching.
