* Beautiful art style, like their other games. Really appealing grey-scale expert pixel art.
* Interesting representation of the chance element of RPGs: fruit machine spinner.
* "Extras" like the campfire and tavern are great. Lots of fun, and feed well into the main quest.
* Rage feature is fun. Hero becomes Hulk-like and animalistic.
* Great UI: big chunky buttons.
