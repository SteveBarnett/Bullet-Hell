* Great mood. The silhouette art style with the art, illustration, and illumination is very compelling. The music is excellent and well-chosen.
* Having giant letters as the blocks of the level is cute. The platforming is fairly basic in terms of the standards set by similar games (Limbo being an obvious inspiration in some parts, and straight up plagiarised in others), but it does have a handful of original and innovative ideas (some great machine / cog bits).
* Controls also aren't very precise, which leads to frustration, and the control system called "intuitive" is anything but!
* Strange avatar. Umlaut? Testicles?
