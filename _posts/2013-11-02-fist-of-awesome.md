* Excellent pixel art graphics. Especially animations of characters and scenery.
* Great sense of humor, especially around the storyline (no spoilers). Makes it fun and appropriately silly.
* Uses thumb sticks on the screen controls. Hiding them actually makes seems to make it better, but it's still not great.
* Starts really well with classic Double Dragon kind of vibes, but doesn't really do something new or different with it.
* Level size is well-judged for the genre: about five minutes. Works well for short bursts of play, but is also well judged for "just one more level."
