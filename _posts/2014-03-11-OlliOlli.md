* Back to basics skateboarding trick-pulling that feels very satisfying. One direction, only downhill, mostly using the joystick for tricks.
* Pleasingly chunky character graphics and nice animations. A light touch has been applied: just enough detail to feel right.
* So much fun to play. Each level has a set of goals (on top of the usual high score and high combo), and completing various sets of them unlocks other levels. Works well to keep you coming back to a level to hone your skills.
* Great music that's worth breaking out the headphones for. Unusual genre for a skate game (electronica), but works really well with the feeling of flow that you establish on a long trick run.
