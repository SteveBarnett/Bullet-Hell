* Incredibly charming papercraft world. That the dev team spent a lot of time playing with actual bits of paper is clear: the tactilaty of the world (folding, animations) is spot on.
* Great use of the cameras, but especially the front-facing one: you keep appearing in the game, and it's surprisingly happy-making.
* Finely judged amount of customizing of the world. It would be too much (or a very different game) to make the whole world, but having it spotted with your creations is lovely. They often crop up unexepctedly and subtly.
* Awesome use of the touch surfaces, especially the rear one. Poking holes in the world is really satisfying.
* Great interface copy. Example: instead of "Location," it uses "Where am I?" It talks in the language of the player. This might have been a side effect of designing for kids.
* Falls into the same trap as many action games: to raise the difficulty they just throw more enemies at you, rather than finding some other way.
