* Very, very, pretty and highly detailed environments. Crispy and shiny in all the right places.
* Not nearly as satisfying as it could be. You don't feel the heft of a good swing: it's just "press up." The destruction from the tee off feels too random, not tied closely enough to your actions; the destruction from SmashBreakers (when you get to steer the flaming ball around) feels too soggy and not fun enough.
* Gets kinda boring kinda quickly. There's not a lot of variation in the game mechanics, and the sub-levels (same location, new bits and pieces) don't feel different enough.
