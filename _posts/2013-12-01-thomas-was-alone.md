* Great scripting and voice-over. Funny and poignant. For the first few levels; starts to grate a little after that. Underlying story is great.
* Subtle and minimal music and sound effects add a slightly otherworldly, dreamy, quality.
* Tilting the world a few degrees to the side somehow makes it more interesting. Why don't more platformers do this?
* Large floating text looks cool, but the continuos re-wrapping of the rest of the text is annoying.
* Very tight controls, very responsive and well-weighted.
* Much more of a platformer than a puzzler. Solutions are usually fairly obvious: skill and timing is being tested rather than puzzle-solving.
